# SpiDate
SpiDate is a sparetime project to get the current plugin version via spigot.org


If you want to copy the code keep in mind to follow these rules:

Do not sell the product or any packages of it.

Do not reditribute it as your own.

Do link this repo when you release anything with it.


The dependencies can be found in the zip uploaded.
You'll need to change a few lines for the correct path.
(These lines: Main:113, Main:162, Main:259, Main:276)
Those might change in the next releases.
